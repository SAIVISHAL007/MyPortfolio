      <h2>My Story</h2>
      <p>I am a passionate and self-driven second-year engineering student with a strong interest in the intersection of technology, creativity, and problem-solving. My journey so far has been shaped by hands-on projects across diverse domains — from machine learning and full-stack web development to cybersecurity and game design. I’ve built real-world solutions like a Water Quality Prediction Model using Random Forest and multi-output regression, and developed a Django-based Hostel Management System with Chatbot, showing initiative in blending backend logic with user-friendly interfaces..</p>
      <p>Alongside my academic path, I am deeply curious about game direction, particularly in action and adventure environments, with a focus on level design, storytelling, and user experience. </p>
	  <p>I also explored advanced technologies like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) by implementing pipelines with LlamaIndex and Gemini, and working with PDF-based document querying systems. I enjoy collaborating with teams, contributing to GitHub-based workflows, and continuously learning through projects, internships, and open-source experimentation</p>
	  <p>In every role I take, I strive to bring creativity, technical depth, and a hunger for learning — aiming to build impactful, scalable, and user-centered solutions.</p>
